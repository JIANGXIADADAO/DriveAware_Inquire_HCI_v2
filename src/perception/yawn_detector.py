    Instead of requiring strictly consecutive wide-mouth frames (which
    breaks on a single dropped landmark), the score accumulates while
    MAR is above threshold and decays when it drops — a brief flicker
    loses only ~15% of accumulated evidence, not all of it.

    The growth/decay model is inspired by the AttentionScorer in
    e-candeloro/Driver-State-Detection.
